# Definition

- **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
    
    SaaS is a software distribution model where a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the internet. Customers can access and use the software through a web browser without the need for installation or maintenance. The provider handles tasks such as infrastructure, security, updates, and support.
    
    Example: Salesforce is a popular SaaS platform that provides customer relationship management (CRM) software. Users can access the Salesforce application through their web browsers and use its features for managing sales, marketing, and customer support without having to worry about infrastructure or software maintenance.
    
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
    
     PaaS refers to a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications. It offers a complete development environment that includes infrastructure, operating system, development tools, and deployment capabilities. Developers can focus on coding and application development, while the PaaS provider handles the underlying infrastructure.
    
    Heroku is a PaaS provider that allows developers to deploy and manage web applications without worrying about server configuration or scalability. Developers can focus on writing code and deploying their applications, while Heroku takes care of the infrastructure and platform management.
    
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
    
    IaaS is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources that can be provisioned and managed by customers. With IaaS, customers have more control over the underlying infrastructure compared to SaaS or PaaS.
    
    Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a prominent IaaS provider. AWS offers virtual machines (EC2), storage services (S3), and networking capabilities, among others. Customers can provision and manage these resources as needed, building their own infrastructure and deploying applications on top of it.
    

In summary, SaaS provides software applications accessible over the internet, PaaS offers a platform for application development and deployment, and IaaS provides virtualized infrastructure resources for customers to build and manage their own applications.

# How to category

1. Layers
2. Responsibilities

- **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
    - **Application Layer:** This layer represents the actual software application that users interact with. It includes the user interface, functionality, and data storage.
    - **Provider's Responsibilities:** The SaaS provider is responsible for hosting, maintaining, and securing the application. They handle infrastructure management, updates, data backups, and technical support.
    - **User's Responsibilities:** Users of the SaaS application simply access and use the software through their web browsers. They don't need to worry about infrastructure, maintenance, or security.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
    - **Application Layer:** Developers build and deploy applications on top of the PaaS platform.
    - **Platform Layer:** This layer provides a development environment, including runtime environments, databases, middleware, and development tools.
    - Provider's Responsibilities: The PaaS provider manages the underlying platform infrastructure, including servers, operating systems, and networking. They also handle scalability, security, and maintenance of the platform.
    - Developer's Responsibilities: Developers focus on coding and application development using the tools and resources provided by the PaaS platform. They don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
    - Infrastructure Layer: This layer represents the fundamental computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, networks, and load balancers.
    - Provider's Responsibilities: The IaaS provider is responsible for provisioning and maintaining the virtualized infrastructure. They handle hardware, networking, virtualization, and data center operations.
    - User's Responsibilities: Customers have more control and responsibility over the infrastructure layer. They manage the operating systems, applications, and data deployed on the virtual machines. Users are responsible for tasks like software installation, security configurations, and scaling resources.

To summarize, the division or realization of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS can be understood by **considering the layers and responsibilities involved.**

- SaaS focuses on delivering complete software applications
- PaaS provides a platform for application development and deployment
- IaaS offers virtualized infrastructure resources for users to build and manage their own applications.
