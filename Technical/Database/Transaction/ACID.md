## ACID

- ### Atomic: 
	- All or nothing
- ### Consistence: 
	- This means that integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction
- ### Isolation: 
	- This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of the database state.
- ### Durability
	- This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs.
